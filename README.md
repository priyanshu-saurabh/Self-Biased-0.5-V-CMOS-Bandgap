# NanoVolt-BGR  
**Sub-1 V CMOS Bandgap Reference with High PSRR**

---

## Overview  
NanoVolt-BGR is a **low-voltage CMOS bandgap reference (BGR)** designed to operate at **supply voltages below 1 V** while maintaining **high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR)**.  
This project provides a **stable, precise, and energy-efficient voltage reference** for analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits operating under **strict power constraints**.

The design is particularly suited for:  
- Ultra-low power systems  
- Energy-constrained sensor nodes  
- Mixed-signal SoCs  
- Next-generation analog front-ends

##  Key Features  
- **Sub-1 V operation** (compatible with modern scaled CMOS technologies)  
- **High PSRR** â€“ robust against supply fluctuations  
- **Temperature stability** across a wide operating range  
- **Energy-efficient** architecture tailored for low-power circuits  
- **Compact area** optimized for integration in SoCs
